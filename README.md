# click-elmo-game
A Clicky Game themed around Elmo built using react and bootstrap and deployed through github pages. 

RULES: 

Click the images, but do not click any more than once! 
If you get all 12, you win! 
If you accidentally click the same image, you will be notified you lost.
If you did better than last round, your score will become the high score.
